## Script Explanation
The script performs these steps:

# Directory Creation: Creates a structured directory system for organizing the data:

bvmt_data/: Main directory
bvmt_data/raw/: Stores downloaded RAR files
bvmt_data/extracted/: Stores extracted text files
bvmt_data/csv/: Stores the final CSV files


# File Download:
- Downloads the RAR file from the provided URL using the requests library
# File Extraction: 
- Extracts the contents of the RAR file using rarfile library
# Data Parsing: 
- Reads the extracted text file and converts it to a pandas DataFrame

The parsing logic includes automatic header detection
It handles various spacing and formatting in the text file


# CSV Conversion: 
Saves the DataFrame to a CSV file
